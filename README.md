# Welcome to Koujo 🔥
Koujo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research 
and production by combining Woolang syntax and ecosystem with systems 
programming and metaprogramming features. Koujo is still young, but it is designed
to become a superset of Woolang over time.  

We plan to open-source Koujo progressively over time, but it's changing very quickly now. 
We believe that a small, tight-knit group of engineers with a shared vision can move 
faster than a community effort, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until 
it's more complete.  Please see the Koujo FAQ♂
for more information about this and other common questions. 

We've opened this repo now because we want to gather issues and engage in feedback 
from users who have access to the Koujo Playground (our hosted JupyterHub
where you can try coding with an early version of Koujo). 
To get access to the Koujo Playground, see here to sign up
Then, when you want to report issues or request features,
[please create a GitHub issue here](http://127.0.0.1).
